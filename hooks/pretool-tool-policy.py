"""PreToolUse:* hook — enforce tool-policy.v1.json for all subagents.

Single hook that consumes the harness ``policies/tool-policy.v1.json`` (resolved
via the shared hooks/lib/claude_home resolver) through
lib.policy_registry.is_allowed() and lib.agent_resolver.resolve_agent_type().

Behavior:
  - Main agent (no agent_id, no subagent_type) -> exit 0 (orchestrator
    gate handles main agent).
  - Subagent role unresolvable -> exit 0 (defer to the backstop shim). An
    unresolved role is a NORMAL state (a subagent may write before any sentinel-
    creating tool runs; agent_resolver LOW-10: callers MUST NOT hard-block on
    None). Role-specific deny is enforced once the role resolves.
  - Resolved role + denied tool/path -> exit 2 with structured stderr
    JSON: {"role", "tool", "target", "deny_reason"}.
  - Deny-logic import/bootstrap failure -> exit 2 (FAIL CLOSED, WS1): the
    security imports live inside a fail-closed bootstrap guard, NOT inside the
    blanket `except Exception: sys.exit(0)` (which would silently fail open).

Bash policy bypass fix (T2.1):
  - For Bash tool, parse the command with lib.bash_write_targets to
    extract every shell write target (heredoc-stripped). Each extracted
    path is authorized as if it were a Write target. The bash command
    itself is also authorized for tool-list membership (target=None).
  - This closes the heredoc/redirect bypass where a subagent could
    write to a protected path via 'cat > FILE << EOF' or similar.

Scratch namespace actor-exactness (LANE-B r02, parent RULING_2 G0 admission):
  - Every write target the prefix layer admits is additionally classified as
    owner scratch / sibling scratch / arbitrary system temp.
  - Owner scratch is allowed for every role; a SIBLING's scratch directory is
    denied for every role; arbitrary /tmp and /var/tmp are denied for every
    role INCLUDING one holding a bare '*' grant, which no prefix list can deny.
  - Each role's OWN pre-existing exact temp prefixes are generated from the
    policy file and survive verbatim.

Fail-safe: any unexpected exception logs to stderr and exits 0 to
avoid bricking the tool pipeline on a hook bug.
